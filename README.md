# To-Do List 

Another To-Do list for training purposes but this time the code is written better and also the looks are not so hideous.

## General info

### Description

Simple App where you can add and delete lists with tasks that need to be done. Each list have indicator of how much tasks are yet completed. By clicking specific task you can toggle its completion and with three buttons you can manage each list.

### Technologies

- React - whole App is built in React (packages installed: react-icons, react-transition-group, sass)
- Sass - used to style the App (sass package installed via npm)

### What's next ?

In the next "better To-Do list" I plan to implement BackEnd. Login authentication with simple database to hold users lists is this App future. Using To-Do list on multiple devices would be really handy!
